"""MCP `paidTool` wrapper for the x402 `exact`-on-`nano` scheme (roadmap stage 1).

Blocks 10-14 built the HTTP half of the protocol: the spec + TS reference
implementation, the self-hostable facilitator (/supported /verify /settle,
fail-closed on >=2 independent Nano RPCs, atomic single-use claim), and the HTTP
402 Resource Server + wire client (httpx402.py): first GET returns 402 + a
`payment-required` header with a one-time nano_ payTo and exact amount; the
client retries with a `payment-signature` (PaymentPayload {paymentProof 64-hex});
the server verifies then settles and serves the protected result 200 +
`payment-response`; a spent/replayed proof is refused.

Roadmap stage 1 also requires an **MCP `paidTool` wrapper**: expose the same
handshake as MCP tools so an MCP *client agent* (not raw HTTP) can request a
protected paid tool, be told the one-time payTo and exact amount, send XNO, then
receive the protected result exactly once. This module is that wrapper. It does
NOT reimplement the protocol — it reuses `ResourceApp` + `Facilitator` from
httpx402.py/facilitator.py, so the exact same verify (>=2 RPC fail-closed) and
settle (atomic single-use claim) logic runs whether the handshake arrives over
HTTP or over MCP.

Two MCP tools (mirroring the HTTP 402 -> pay -> verify -> settle -> 200 flow):

  paid_tool_request(tool, params?) -> issues a fresh one-time requirement via
      ResourceApp.begin(); returns {tool, request_id, pay_to, amount_raw,
      scheme, network, asset}. Stateless: no resource-side state is stored;
      the one-time payTo is derived deterministically from (master, request_id).
  paid_tool_execute(tool, request_id, payment_proof) -> re-derives the exact
      requirements the server would issue for that request_id, builds the
      PaymentPayload, and runs ResourceApp.complete() (verify then settle). On
      settlement success it runs the protected tool and returns its result;
      a spent/replayed proof is refused (facilitator atomic claim).

The wrapper never moves, holds or guards funds: the agent sends XNO itself to
the one-time payTo from its own wallet; 'settlement' is binding the on-chain
proof exactly once. All money math and proof binding live in the facilitator.
